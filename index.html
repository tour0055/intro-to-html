      <p>
        Hello, my name is <strong>Mamadou</strong>. I am passionate about military intelligence and defense strategy. I have always been fascinated by how intelligence operations protect lives and ensure national security. My analytical mindset makes me naturally suited for this field.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently developing my knowledge and skills in intelligence gathering, strategic operations, and security analysis. I believe learning is a lifelong journey, and my ultimate goal is to contribute meaningfully to national security initiatives and eventually become a director of intelligence.
